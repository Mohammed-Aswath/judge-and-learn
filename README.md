## 🛠 Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with hooks and functional components
- **Redux Toolkit** for state management
- **Material-UI (MUI v5)** for UI components
- **Monaco Editor** for code editing
- **Recharts** for data visualization

- **Admin**: `admin@test.com` / `admin123`
- **Professor**: `prof@test.com` / `prof123`
- **Student**: `student@test.com` / `student123`

## 🎯 Core Features Status

### ✅ Completed (Frontend)
- [x] Complete authentication system with demo credentials
- [x] Role-based routing and permissions
- [x] Admin dashboard with college/user management
- [x] Professor tools for class and student management
- [x] Student interface with code editor and submissions

### 🚧 Next Steps (Backend Integration)
- [ ] Backend scaffold with all routes and models
- [ ] Real Judge API integration
- [ ] Docker containerization
- [ ] ML pipeline implementation
- [ ] WebSocket real-time updates
- [ ] Production deployment setup

## 🔄 API Integration Points

The frontend is designed to seamlessly switch from mock data to real APIs:

### Judge API Contract
```javascript
POST /api/judge/submit
{
  "userId": "string",
  "problemId": "string", 
  "language": "python|cpp|java",
  "sourceCode": "string",
  "timeLimitMs": 2000,
  "memoryLimitMb": 256
}

Response:
{
  "submissionId": "string",
  "status": "queued|running|completed|failed",
  "results": [...],
  "totalPassed": 3,
  "totalTests": 4
}
```

### ML Recommendations API
```javascript
GET /api/ml/recommendations?userId=...

Response:
{
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "problemId": "string",
      "score": 0.95,
      "reason": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Production Readiness

- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimized rendering
- **Security**: XSS protection and secure authentication ready

## 📈 Next Implementation Phase

1. **Backend Development**: Complete Node.js backend with all endpoints
2. **Judge Integration**: Real code execution environment with Docker
3. **ML Pipeline**: Actual recommendation system with HuggingFace
4. **Real-time Features**: WebSocket implementation for live updates
5. **Deployment**: Docker containers and Kubernetes manifests

## 🤝 Development Guidelines

- **Component-based architecture** with clear separation of concerns
- **Redux for global state**, React state for component-local state  
- **Mock data first**, real API integration second
- **TypeScript-ready** structure (currently JavaScript for demo)
- **Test-friendly** component design

## 📞 Support

This is a complete frontend implementation ready for backend integration. All API calls are abstracted through service layers, making it easy to switch from mock data to real endpoints.

The platform demonstrates enterprise-level architecture with proper state management, role-based access control, and production-ready UI/UX patterns.
